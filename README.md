# coinmarketcap_scraper

It's a Python(Scrapy) based scraper to scrape Crypto data from [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) which is the world's most-referenced price-tracking website for cryptoassets in the rapidly growing cryptocurrency space.

# Dependencies:
- Install Python and the following libraries:
1) Scrapy

# Usage:
- This website might block your IP so you would have to use proxies. 
- You can put your HTTP proxy URL at line no. 5 in code(I'd suggest packetstream proxies)
- Now run the script. It will take around 20 minutes to get data for all cryptocurrencies.
